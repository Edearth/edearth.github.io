I'm starting this blog in hopes of actually doing something productive in my free time.

This post is going to be revised, edited, updated and changed. Just so you know what this will be about, let me introduce myself:

I'm a developer that was born in Spain and dreams of moving somewhere cooler. Right now I've been working as a software developer / QA / tester for 2 years and 3 months, according to my LinkedIn profile. I live and work in Barcelona and my passions are eating and slacking, software, video games and cooking. I praise minimalism and calm, trying to be by myself in order to achieve both in my life (often failing). A life of literary consumption has made me enjoy writing long-winded sentences with dots spread too far apart and a nerdy sense of humour imbued in them. You've been warned.

I've always wanted to have my own blog but blogging frameworks seemed too "bulky" and/or had a bit of a reputation for being insecure. And ready-made blog-managing-and-hosting solutions were not as customizable and open as I liked, so I never got past thinking about it. Let's see how this turns out! \o/
