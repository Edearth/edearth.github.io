We have the feeling that sending our data to companies is not good
But we don't _know_ how bad it is

What point can be made for non-techie people on a hurry to realize how bad and unacceptable this is?

A quick summary/tl;dr for those in a hurry:

1. They know more than you know
2. They can (and will) misinterpret that data
3. They will act on that data (Naive interventionism) (the road to hell is paved with good intentions, imagine if they don't even have that and are looking just for their profit)
4. If it's sent/stored it can be leaked
5. That data will be used against you, intentionally or unintentionally

## Derived information

We don't realize the kind of information that can be derived from basic points of data like our location, who we give a like or what sites we visit.

## Misinterpretation

Taleb quote on big data

“A very rarely discussed property of data: it is toxic in large quantities – even in moderate quantities.”

"We’re more fooled by noise than ever before, and it’s because of a nasty phenomenon called “big data.” With big data, researchers have brought cherry-picking to an industrial level.

Modernity provides too many variables, but too little data per variable. So the spurious relationships grow much, much faster than real information.

In other words: Big data may mean more information, but it also means more false information.
"

## Naive intervention

> But the female-body trackers have an agenda: They make money by showing their users ads, and they are increasingly interested in studying them for science. Glow, for example, looked at its users’ periods en masse and claimed they correlated with the phases of the moon. It seems that companies with access to our health information and daily behavior via our smartphones can’t help but turn us into guinea pigs.
