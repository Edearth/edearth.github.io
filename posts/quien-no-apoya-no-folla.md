 Most cultures have their own drinking rituals, but Spanish/Catalan spice their drinking up with "spicy" sonnets and a collaborative dance.

I'm sure that most cultures have their own, fascinating alcohol related rituals.
From the US ["Buffalo game"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_(game)) to Germany's Oktoberfest. From XXXXXXXXXX to exclusively pouring other people's drink in Japan.

But out of all the drinking rituals out there, there is one in Spain that fascinates me. 
It consist of reciting a fun sexual rhyme while performing a stupid action with your drink.
This seems simple enough, but the fun begins when you start chaining multiple rhymes together.
In some special occasions a regular cheer might transform into a 2 minute dance, accompanied with a special song recited by a _merry_ choir.

This is fun on it's own.
In one moment, the entire group spontaneously begins chanting and performing.
It's stupid and it encourages drinking and laughing.
The rhymes are quite varied and, though generally use the man's perspective, there are some that are exclusively for women and most can be used by both genders.
And one of the best things is each different group seems to have a different one.
So it's very fun meeting someone new, going out for a drink with their friends and finding out about a new limerick that you can add to your repertoire. 

It's my hope to make a compilation of rhymes so that humankind does never lose this small cultural treasure. 
I plan to follow each of these sonnets with a detailed diagram on how to perform the action that follows it, for reproducibility.
If you have a rhyme that's not in the compilation, feel free to message me and I'll gladly add it to the list.

It goes without saying that these "poems" are quite obscene and they should be reserved for very informal meetings.
Also, they must be used exclusively with alcoholic drinks, lest it bring bad luck as the popular saying goes.

Enjoy and cheers! üçª
