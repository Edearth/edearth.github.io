    <div class="article-content">
      <p><p>Do you remember how, for a brief moment in human history, you could fix machines by using violence? No university degrees or user manuals required, just a good ole slap o‚Äô the hand to the side or top of the idiot box. And there you go, it works again! This could‚Äôve been caused by a connection error, some faulty wires that didn‚Äôt properly transmit the video signal. But the point is you didn‚Äôt have to know about that, it used to be a magic solution that sometimes fixed stuff.</p>
<p>We don‚Äôt have wires anymore, for the most part. Most of our electronics use a PCB with each component attached to it (usually soldered or screwed). They‚Äôre so pervasive and easy to produce you could even use them for garage projects! It‚Äôs as easy as printing an image, transfering the ink to the board, applying some chemicals and drilling some holes. And they look <em>waaay better</em> than a mess of cables connecting everything.</p>

<p>While listening to <a href="https://cyberpunklibrarian.com/podcast/cyberpunk-librarian-episode-05-charlie-buckets-dad/">episode 5 (‚ÄúCharlie Bucket‚Äôs dad‚Äù)</a> from Daniel Messer‚Äôs (<a href="https://twitter.com/bibrarian">@bibrarian</a>) ‚ÄúCyberpunk Librarian‚Äù podcast, I realized our problems are now mostly digital. We‚Äôve figured if we remove the wires we won‚Äôt have faulty wires anymore. But that doesn‚Äôt mean we fixed the ‚Äúconnection error‚Äù problem. In the digital world we could have an API or program failing because we entered the wrong parameters. Or, if we have a long chain of different pieces (which could be another definition of what a computer or the Internet is), it could be any of those pieces failing.</p>
<p>What this means is most of the times we can‚Äôt apply a magic solution and hope for the best. Well, turning it off and on again works sometimes, but it won‚Äôt fix all problems. We need to really understand the problem in order to fix it. This is captured very well on Julia Evans‚Äô (<a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">@b0rk</a>) <a href="https://mysteries.wizardzines.com/">debugging adventure games</a>. In these you investigate a problem, finding clues like if it were a Phoenix Wright game, until you find out the root cause and fix it. Bits of knowledge about a digital problem, that we solve with digital tools.</p>
<p>Even though ‚Äútool‚Äù calls up a very physical mental image (like a wrench, hammer or a voltmeter with a display, switch knob and probes), digital problems in digital systems require digital tools to solve. And to use those tools we sometimes need to read documentation, experiment and fix/replace them when they stop working. Just like physical tools!</p>
<p>Daniel‚Äôs point about familiarizing yourself with your tools is as valid in software development as it is with librarian tools (or physical tools in a physical job üòõ). Yet, perhaps because of the amount of tools or their ‚Äúlocality‚Äù (eg. Apple ecosystem used just for Apple development), this is a difficult task. But you‚Äôre doing yourself a disservice if you don‚Äôt. Learning about your tools is a good way to find ways to make your job easier. You stop depending on others to fix things, you grow your knowledge base, you do a more rewarding job and with your own individual background you could find an obvious solution that isn‚Äôt obvious to anybody else. Like in the example at the beginning of the post: By understanding the wires were causing the connection problem, we can ask ourselves: can we fix them? Can we use something cheaper without that issue?</p>
<p>That‚Äôs all. This post was mostly an excuse to share work by some people I like and this stupid realization I had üòÑ</p></p>
