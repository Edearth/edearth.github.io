## The 5 parts of ramen

Most ramen bowls are made of these 5 different parts.
Understanding them can
help us gain some intuition on making ramen,
allow us to achieve the perfect flavor all the time
and appreciate each bowl more
(a good part of art is interpretation, after all ðŸ˜„).

### Tare (the seasoning)

The first flavor you'll probably taste in the soup.
When you take that first sip
and you feel that **punch** with all those different flavors,
tare is responsible for it.

The tare is just a seasoning,
don't let the list of ingredients fool you.
You want it to be salty because it's gonna be the "salt" to your broth,
and it will dilute in the liquid.
But don't just focus on salt,
try to hit other tastes like umami, sweet, sour...
Don't be afraid to use all the white powders
(salt, MSG and sugar).

### Base broth:

The second protagonist in the flavor department.
Along the tare, it will be what gives
most of the flavor to the liquids in your bowl.
You want to make a good soup without adding salt to it.
You'll be seasoning it with the tare when you assemble the bowl.

It is also responsible for the texture/mouth feel of the soup.
Most bone/meat based soups get their consistency from gelatin or fat.
If you are making a vegetarian and you want it to be thick,
you might want to experiment with other thickening agents
(like roux, agar-agar...).

You can never go wrong starting with the basic
mirepoix ingredients (carrot, celery and onion).

### Oil:

Often forgotten in _amateur_ recipes,
this is the main aromatic component
and one that can take your ramen bowl from ok to great.
When you enter a ramen shop,
this is what's causing that warm, comforting, mouth-watering smell.

But it doesn't just add arome,
it also has some subtle flavor notes
that stay longer in the mouth.

### Noodles:

Asd

### Toppings:

Toppings. They're wild.
You can literally put whatever you want on top of your ramen.
From the simple steamed vegetables or rehydrated mushrooms,
to breaded marinated tofu or meat.

If we want to go the "brazilian pizza toppings" way,
you could even put a truck tire on it.
But please don't ðŸ˜¬

## Why should I learn how to do all this? I just want some soup!

We cook each part separately
because we want to be able to
control each bowl separately.
If we cook everything together
the first bowl might be fine.
But if we try to reheat it,
it will lose water,
which might make the soup saltier.

It also gives us a different understanding of the food.
Making an entire ramen bowl from the ground up
might seem intimidating because of all the different steps.
But if we break it into its individual components,
they will be easier to prepare.
Not only that,
we will understand what we want to achieve with that ingredient,
which will allow us to experiment with new approaches,
different ingredients, techniques from other recipes, etc.
to try to achieve our goal
(eg. making roux to thicken our soup in a veggie ramen,
kind of like fat and bone gelatin would in a bone broth ramen).
