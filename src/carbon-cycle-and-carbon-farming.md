# The carbon cycle

Carbon taken from atmosphere and locked away into plants and organic matter in the soil
this is a closed system. explain what that is. Trees, soil and water store carbon like batteries
it's also a zero-sum system. explain what that is, and also mention that it isn't really, but it's close

The problem with fossil fuels is that we're breaking this cycle completely.
When we burn them, we add CO2 to the atmosphere.
Remember this is a closed, zero-sum system.
We're adding CO2 to the atmosphere
and we're not adding more trees.
In fact, the forested area percentage is on a steady decline trajectory

The oceans are absorbing carbon
and they're becoming acidic because of this.
The more farming plots we have,
the less carbon is stored in soil. 

# Our responsibility

We're fucking up the balance of our ecosystem.
The consequences of allowing that to happen
can be seen in YouTube series
"Kurtis in a Jar", by Kurtis Baute.

In it, he seals himself in a plastic greenhouse.
CO2 builds up and soon he starts feeling
the changes in his physiology.
* List symptoms

Chances are if you're reading this article
you have easy access to clear water.
Did you ever drink muddy water? Would you like to?
Because the atmosphere is a fluid,
just like water,
and we're "muddying" it with CO2.
Just as Kurtis had trouble breathing and thinking,
so may we when the CO2 concentration gets higher.

# What is carbon farming?

essentially it's a carbon battery

microbes + fungi transfer that carbon
into the soil it came from
which in turns makes it easier
for other plants to grow and store more carbon

benefits lost if threes chopped / burned
carbon is released to the atmosphere again
fruit+nut trees serve another purpose too,
so it's easier to justify not cutting them



# What can _I_ do?

How to make your goverment protect forests
and hold them accountable for their 

Plant trees if you can.

Buy fruits and nuts (local, if possible)
so that more farmers plant fruit trees.
It'll cause a small impact, but it'll be an incentive for them.

# What can _I_ do?

You're not the sole responsible,
but that doesn't mean you're not responsible for it.
We're all in this together.
No human being can decide
"I don't want to be part of this Earth anymore" yet.

### 1. Eat less meat. 

You don't need to stop eating it,
but you could try having some meatless days during the week.
Maybe you don't eat meat on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Maybe after a month you can confine your meat eating
to Wednesday and Saturday.
It is **not** a sacrifice, there's a world 
of flavors if you try your hand at vegetarian recipes.

I started transitioning into a vegetarian diet
after a trip to Galicia with my friends.
I started realizing, while in the trip,
that all the meals we have had contained some
kind of meat, fish or seafood. All of them,
save the _tortilla de patatas_ we got with some beer.
When I came back home I decided I'd eat meat
only a couple of days per week.
In time I changed that to be only 2 meals per week.
Then 2 meals every 2 weeks.
And if I had a small relapse, I just started again.
It's bound to happen, we're only human after all.

And to everyone who tells you only one person
won't change the world, you can take them to a supermarket
and show them all the vegetarian replacement products.
Or take them to a restaurant and check
all the veggie alternatives in there
(fucking Burger King has a vegetarian burger already!).
Vegetarians created an entire market.
Lots of individuals create lots of demand,
and when there's demand, there's supply.
The meat industry is driven by consumption as well,
so the more vegetarians, the less meat that will be produced.

### 2. Drive less

Use public transport.
Don't take planes if you can avoid it.

### 3. Be vocal

You don't have to evangelize anyone,
but it's perfectly ok to talk about
why you are doing what you're doing.
You can voice your opinion,
you can disprove myths
and you can be the model for someone else.

You never know, you might be the reason someone:

* Loses their fear of people criticizing/mocking them
for becoming vegetarian.
* Started thinking about how their actions really matter.
* ...

# Final

We can reduce our CO2 emissions now.
We don't need crazy technological leaps
to heal the damage our unchecked consumption is causing.
We have the technology, right now,
to reduce our emissions and delay a catastrophe.
This is not someone else's responsibility.
Are you going to keep ignoring yours?
